# NEUROCARTA 
***A Toolbox for Reconstruction and Analysis of Neural Networks***  
  
## About  
Neurocarta is a MATLAB/Octave toolbox for the reconstruction and analysis of neural networks. It utilizes data from the [Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas](https://connectivity.brain-map.org) (AMBCA), a database featuring of quantifications of targeted neuronal projections throughout the mouse brain. These quantifications are extracte from imaging experiments where fluorescent protein expressing viral tracers are injected in anatomically defined brain areas. At the time of writing the AMBCA consists of 2917 experiments.

Neurocarta compiles the neuronal projections data into network representations of the anatomical connectivity in the mouse brain. It also provides functionality to further analyze said networks using graph theoretical tools, and to investigate individual experiments from the AMBCA. A publication is currently being written to illustrate how Neurocarta can be used in research.

Installing the toolbox is done by using `git clone` or simply downloading from Github. All necessary code is contained in the Toolbox folder. The repository contains some pre-existing data that cannot be downloaded; a manually compiled list of nodes to use for network compilation. The file **startup.m** is automatically ran when starting MATLAB in the toolbox folder, and adds all the necessary directories to the search path.

Build the database by running **build_database**, this downloads and imports acomplete AMBCA (stored in Data) and metadata (stored in Structures). One can download only a subset of the AMBCA using the search function on their website and storing the result in a custom experiments.csv file placed in the Structures directory. The build_database function is stoppable and will pick up where it left when restarted.

Once installed, individual experiments can be visualized using the **autocorrelatemap** function and compared with **crosscorrelatemaps**. Moving on, use **loadmap** to compile a network from the projections data. This function returns a bilateral adjacency matrix where every entry `(i, j)` represents the normalized axonal density originating in structure `i`, and targeting structure `j`. This matrix is used for further analysis and can be entered into the various functions found in the Networks_analysis folder.
